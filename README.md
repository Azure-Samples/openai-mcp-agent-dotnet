# .NET OpenAI MCP Agent

This is an MCP agent app written in .NET, using Azure OpenAI, with a remote MCP server written in TypeScript.

## Features

This app provides features like:

- The MCP host + MCP client app is written in [.NET Blazor](https://aka.ms/blazor).
- The MCP client app connects to a to-do MCP server written in TypeScript.
- Both MCP client and server apps are running on [Azure Container Apps (ACA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/overview).
- The MCP client app is secured by the built-in auth of ACA.
- The MCP server app is only accessible from the MCP client app.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) + [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) LTS
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) or [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/downloads)
- [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)

## Getting Started

You can now use GitHub Codespaces to run this sample app (takes several minutes to open it)! ðŸ‘‰ [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/openai-mcp-agent-dotnet).

### Get Azure AI Foundry or GitHub Models

- To run this app, you should have either [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry) instance or [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace?type=models).
- If you use Azure AI Foundry, make sure you have the [GPT-5-mini models deployed](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/deploy-models-openai) deployed.
- As a default, the deployed model name is `gpt-5-mini`.

### Get AI Agent App

1. Create a directory for the app.

    ```bash
    # zsh/bash
    mkdir -p openai-mcp-agent-dotnet
    ```

    ```powershell
    # PowerShell
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path openai-mcp-agent-dotnet -Force
    ```

1. Initialize `azd`.

    ```bash
    cd openai-mcp-agent-dotnet
    azd init -t openai-mcp-agent-dotnet
    ```

   > **NOTE**: You'll be asked to enter an environment name, which will be the name of your Azure Resource Group. For example, the environment name might be `openai-mcp-agent`.

1. Make sure that your deployed model name is `gpt-5-mini`. If your deployed model is different, update `src/McpTodo.ClientApp/appsettings.json`.

    ```jsonc
    {
      "OpenAI": {
        // Make sure this is the right deployment name.
        "DeploymentName": "gpt-5-mini"
      }
    }
    ```

1. Add Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key. The Azure OpenAI endpoint MUST end with `openai.azure.com/`.

    ```bash
    dotnet user-secrets --project ./src/McpTodo.ClientApp set OpenAI:Endpoint {{AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}}
    dotnet user-secrets --project ./src/McpTodo.ClientApp set OpenAI:ApiKey {{AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY}}
    ```

   > **NOTE**: If you want to use OpenAI API, add the API key only. The OpenAI API key SHOULD start with `sk-proj-`.
   >
   > ```bash
   > dotnet user-secrets --project ./src/McpTodo.ClientApp set OpenAI:ApiKey {{OPENAI_API_KEY}}
   > ```

### Get MCP Server App

1. Clone the MCP server.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mcp-container-ts.git ./src/McpTodo.ServerApp
    ```

1. Set JWT token.

    ```bash
    # zsh/bash
    ./scripts/set-jwttoken.sh
    ```

    ```powershell
    # PowerShell
    ./scripts/Set-JwtToken.ps1
    ```

### Run on Azure

1. Check that you have the necessary permissions:
   - Your Azure account must have the `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permission, such as [Role Based Access Control Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/privileged#role-based-access-control-administrator), [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/privileged#user-access-administrator), or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/privileged#owner) at the subscription level.
   - Your Azure account must also have the `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` permission at the subscription level.

1. Login to Azure.

    ```bash
    azd auth login
    ```

1. Add user secrets to azd environment.

    ```bash
    # zsh/bash
    secrets=$(dotnet user-secrets --project ./src/McpTodo.ClientApp list --json | \
        grep -v '^//' | jq -r '.')

    azd env set OPENAI_ENDPOINT $(echo "$secrets" | jq -r '.["OpenAI:Endpoint"]')
    azd env set OPENAI_API_KEY $(echo "$secrets" | jq -r '.["OpenAI:ApiKey"]')
    ```

    ```powershell
    # PowerShell
    $secrets = dotnet user-secrets --project ./src/McpTodo.ClientApp list --json | `
        Select-String -NotMatch '^//(BEGIN|END)' | ConvertFrom-Json

    azd env set OPENAI_ENDPOINT $secrets.'OpenAI:Endpoint'
    azd env set OPENAI_API_KEY $secrets.'OpenAI:ApiKey'
    ```

   > **NOTE**: If you want to use Azure Keyless access, please follow this document, [Use Azure OpenAI without keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/ai/keyless-connections).

1. Add JWT token to azd environment.

    ```bash
    # zsh/bash
    env_dir=".azure/$(azd env get-value AZURE_ENV_NAME)"
    mkdir -p "$env_dir"
    cat ./src/McpTodo.ServerApp/.env >> "$env_dir/.env"
    ```

    ```powershell
    # PowerShell
    $dotenv = Get-Content ./src/McpTodo.ServerApp/.env
    $dotenv | Add-Content -Path ./.azure/$(azd env get-value AZURE_ENV_NAME)/.env -Encoding utf8 -Force
    ```

1. Deploy apps to Azure.

    ```bash
    azd up
    ```

   > **NOTE**:
   >
   > 1. By default, the MCP client app is protected by the ACA built-in auth feature. You can turn off this feature before running `azd up` by setting:
   >
   >    ```bash
   >    azd env set USE_LOGIN false
   >    ```
   >
   > 1. During the deployment, you will be asked to enter the Azure Subscription and location.

1. In the terminal, get the client app URL deployed. It might look like:

    ```bash
    https://mcptodo-clientapp.{{some-random-string}}.{{location}}.azurecontainerapps.io/
    ```

1. Navigate to the client app URL, log-in to the app and enter prompts like:

    ```text
    Give me list of to do.
    Set "meeting at 1pm".
    Give me list of to do.
    Mark #1 as completed.
    Delete #1 from the to-do list.
    ```

   > **NOTE**: You might not be asked to login, if you've set the `USE_LOGIN` value to `false`.

1. Clean up all the resources deployed.

    ```bash
    azd down --force --prune
    ```
